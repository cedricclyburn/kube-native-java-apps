IMPORTANT: You need to finish the <<Kubernetes Deployment>> section before advancing into adjusting resources.

By default, containers run with unbounded compute resources on a Kubernetes cluster. Developer Sandbox is a managed OpenShift environment, and its cluster resources are tailored per development needs.

[#limits]
== Discovering project resource limits

With resource quotas, cluster administrators can restrict resource consumption and creation on a namespace basis.
There will always be concerns that one Pod or Container could monopolize all available resources.
To avoid that, within a namespace, a Pod or Container can consume as much CPU and memory as defined by the `namespace's/project's` resource quota.

To discover the resource quota established for your namespace/project you can run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get resourcequota
kubectl get limitrange
----
At namespace/project level a LimitRange policy is employed to constrain resource allocations (to Pods or Containers).
You can find out the LimitRange established for a namespace by running `oc get limitrange` and ask for its description via:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl describe limitrange resource-limits
----

The output should be something similar to:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
Name:       resource-limits
Namespace:  <your-user>-dev
Type        Resource  Min  Max  Default Request  Default Limit  Max Limit/Request Ratio
----        --------  ---  ---  ---------------  -------------  -----------------------
Container   cpu       -    -    10m              1              -
Container   memory    -    -    64Mi             750Mi          -
----

The above LimitRange has enforced the default request/limit for compute resources in the namespace and automatically injects them to Containers at runtime.

== Adjusting container resources

By using a tool called https://github.com/rakyll/hey[hey], you can run a simple load test on your server and see how your system performs under different circumstances.

Let's expose the service deployed in <<Kubernetes Deployment>> section by using the browser terminal and type:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc expose svc quarkus-app-workshop
----

Let's run a hey command against the route exposed by previous deployment:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
export ROUTE_URL=http://$(kubectl get route quarkus-app-workshop -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
hey -n 1000 -c 200 $ROUTE_URL/api
----

In the Developer Sandbox click on `Observe` and select the `Metric` tab.
You can select CPU Usage or Memory Usage query to check the resources consumed by each of your pods:

[.mt-4.center]
image::cpu_usage.png[CPU Usage,600,600,align="center"]

[.mt-4.center]
image::memory_usage.png[Memory Usage,600,600,align="center"]

Based on that you can adjust your container resources in `application.properties`:

[.console-input]
[source,properties]
----
# Configuration file

quarkus.kubernetes.resources.limits.cpu=200m
quarkus.kubernetes.resources.limits.memory=280Mi
quarkus.kubernetes.resources.requests.cpu=100m
quarkus.kubernetes.resources.requests.memory=140Mi
----

The resources in `target/kubernetes` folder will be reworked at compile time and contain these new definitions.

You can now re-deploy the changes by using the command:

[.console-input]
[source,properties]
----
mvn clean package -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true -Dquarkus.container-image.push=true
----

[#health]
== Define custom health checks

=== Add the health monitoring extension

In the terminal window please execute the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,config,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-health"
----

If you did not stop DevMode and inspect again `target/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml`, you
will notice that it had changed. Your `Deployment` resource will contain a few lines like to:

[.console-input]
[source,config,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
          livenessProbe:
            failureThreshold: 3
            httpGet:
              path: /q/health/live
              port: 8080
              scheme: HTTP
            initialDelaySeconds: 0
            periodSeconds: 30
            successThreshold: 1
            timeoutSeconds: 10
          name: tutorial-app
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: http
              protocol: TCP
          readinessProbe:
            failureThreshold: 3
            httpGet:
              path: /q/health/ready
              port: 8080
              scheme: HTTP
            initialDelaySeconds: 0
            periodSeconds: 30
            successThreshold: 1
            timeoutSeconds: 10
----

TIP: You can access these endpoints also in your local at http://localhost:8080/q/health/ready or http://localhost:8080/q/health/live.

=== Default health checks

In dev mode, all your heath checks are visible in health UI: http://localhost:8080/q/health-ui/.

Some extensions may provide default health checks, including that the extension will automatically register its health checks.
For example, `quarkus-agroal` (that is used to manage Quarkus datasources)  automatically registers a readiness health check that will validate each datasource.

Quarkus has automatic readiness probes added when you use certain extensions:

** *datasource*
A probe to check database connection status.

** *kafka*
A probe to check kafka connection status. In this case you need to enable manually by setting quarkus.kafka.health.enabled to true.

** *mongoDB*
A probe to check MongoDB connection status.

** *neo4j*
A probe to check Neo4J connection status.

** *artemis*
A probe to check Artemis JMS connection status.

** *kafka-streams*
Liveness (for stream state) and Readiness (topics created) probes.

** *vault*
A probe to check Vault conection status.

** *gRPC*
A readiness probe for the gRPC services.

** *Cassandra*
A readiness probe to check Cassandra connection status.

** *Redis*
A readiness probe to check Redis connection status.

=== Customize health endpoints and readiness probe

You can change the root path to the health endpoints by setting the following property in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

[.console-input]
[source,config,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
quarkus.smallrye-health.root-path=/health
----

The Quarkus Kubernetes extension will take into account your custom probe definitions when generating their YAML.
If you reload the context in DevMode (by pressing `s`), you would notice that your Kubernetes/OpenShift manifests have changed and take into account your new configuration.

We can customize a readiness probe to check the availability of the endpoint `https://www.boredapi.com`:


[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import io.smallrye.health.checks.UrlHealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Readiness;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.ws.rs.HttpMethod;

@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomHealthCheck {

    @ConfigProperty(name = "quarkus.rest-client.\"org.acme.ActivityService\".url")
    String externalURL;

    @Readiness //<1> 
    HealthCheck checkURL() {
        return new UrlHealthCheck(externalURL) //<2>
                .name("external-url-check").requestMethod(HttpMethod.GET).statusCode(200);
    }

}
----

<1> Annotate the method with `org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Readiness` to signal its implementation.
<2> `UrlHealthCheck` checks if host is reachable using a Http URL connection.

[TIP]
====
Quarkus comes with some HealthCheck implementations for you to check status of different components:

** SocketHealthCheck: checks if host is reachable using a socket.
** UrlHealthCheck: checks if host is reachable using a Http URL connection.
** InetAddressHealthCheck: checks if host is reachable using InetAddress.isReachable method.
