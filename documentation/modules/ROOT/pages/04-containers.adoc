== Quay account

By creating your Red Hat Developer account you also have access to http://quay.io[Quay, window="_blank"]

[#dockerfile]
== Using dockerfiles

A Dockerfile is where you'll estabilish the definitions used to build a container image. It uses three main keywords/commands:

* FROM: where you'll inform the base image used to build your own image
* ADD: where you'll add resources (files) to your image
* CMD: where you'll inform how to start the application

[TIP]
====
Sometimes people ask when to use ADD and when to use COPY. Both of them can be used to copy files from the source to destination, but:

* ADD: The source can only be the host
* COPY: The source can be the host or a remote URL 
====

To let this application ready to be distributed, let's package it:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
mvn package
----


== Building a Dockerfile

Create a file named Dockerfile.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11

ADD target/quarkus-app/lib/ /deployments/lib/
ADD target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar /deployments/app.jar
ADD target/quarkus-app/app/ /deployments/app/
ADD target/quarkus-app/quarkus/ /deployments/quarkus/

CMD ["java", "-jar", "/deployments/app.jar"]
----

IMPORTANT: You might have noticed that Quarkus already created some Dockerfiles for you in `src/main/docker` and in the end we will be using those. Here we just want you to learn how to craft your own Dockerfile.

=== Building the image 

With the Dockerfile that we created in the last step, let's build a container image:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker build -t my-image .
----

You'll see an output like this:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
Sending build context to Docker daemon  10.95MB

----

==== Listing the available images

To see your just create image, just run:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker images
----

You'll see at least these two outputs:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
REPOSITORY                                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
my-image                                     latest              87776d35fc85        4 minutes ago       516MB
registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11   latest              e502114b0d20        2 months ago        505MB
----

Your image is the `my-image` and the `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11` is the image used to build yours.

==== Removing images

To remove your just created image:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker rmi my-image
----

=== Running containers

As we removed the image on the previous step, we need to build it again:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker build -t my-image .
----

Now we are ready to create a container based on this image. Just run:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker create --name my-container my-image
----

You container is created. 

=== Listing containers

To see your newly created container:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker ps
----

Your output is probably something like this:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
----

Why isn't your container in the list if you've just created it?

Because it isn't running, and using plain `docker ps` will only list the running containers. Now try this:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker ps -a
----

Now your output should be something like this:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
ccaadddf1c48        my-image            "java -jar /deployme…"   3 minutes ago       Created                                 my-container
----

It's listing all containers, not matter the status. Your container is listed as `Created`.


=== Starting containers

To run the container you've just created execute this:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker start my-container
----

To check if it's running, try the plain `docker ps` again:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker ps
----

Now your output will be like this:


[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                          NAMES
ccaadddf1c48        my-image            "java -jar /deployme…"   8 minutes ago       Up 54 seconds       8080/tcp, 8443/tcp, 8778/tcp   my-container
----

Notice that the status now is `Up 54 seconds`.

=== Stopping containers

To stop your container:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker stop my-container
----

=== Removing containers

To remove your container:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker rm my-container
----

=== Creating and starting a container at once

Instead of creating a container and then starting, you can do it at once:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker run --name my-container my-image
----


Notice that you terminal is attached to the container process. If you use `CTRL+C`, the container will stop.

So let's create a detached container. First we remove this one:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker rm my-container
----

And now we create it detached:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker run -d --name my-container my-image
----

=== Checking the log of a container

To see what this container is logging, use this:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker logs my-container
----

If you want to keep following the output:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker logs -f my-container
----

Use `CTRL+C` to stop following the log.

=== Port

The application running inside your container can be accessed through the port 8080, so let's try it:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl localhost:8080/hello
----

You should have gotten this output:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8080: Connection refused
----

This is happening because we need to explicit expose the ports you need, and we didn't do it so far. So let's fix it.

First let's remove the container:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker rm -f my-container
----

[TIP]
====
Did you see something different?

We used the `-f` flag to force the removal of the container even if its running. Be careful when using it! 
====

Now we re-create the container, but exposing the port 8080:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker run -d --name my-container -p 8080:8080 my-image
----

Let's try to reach the application again:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl localhost:8080/hello
----

You now got this output:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
hello
----

Meaning that your application is now accessible.

=== Pushing an image to a public registry

So far you've been working with your container image locally. Now let's take it to a remote registry.


First you'll need to tag your image accordingly to your Quay account:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker tag my-image quay.io/rhdevelopers/quarkus-app-workshop
----

Replace `rhdevelopers` with your Red Hat Developer username.


Also, if you build your image already using the tag, you won't need to do this step before pushing it. In our case it would be like this:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker build -t quay.io/rhdevelopers/quarkus-app-workshop .
----



IMPORTANT: From this point, replace `myrepository` with the name of your own repository.

If you now run `docker images` you'll see something like this:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
REPOSITORY                                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
my-image                                     latest              a63dec174904        55 minutes ago      516MB
quay.io/rhdevelopers/quarkus-app-workshop    latest              a63dec174904        55 minutes ago      516MB
----

It's now ready to be pushed. Before doing it, you just need to login into your Docker Hub account within your terminal:

[.console-input]  
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker login quay.io
----

And finally you can push it:

[.console-input]  
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker push quay.io/rhdevelopers/quarkus-app-workshop
----

IMPORTANT: By default, in Quay your image won't be public. You need to go on the Web Interface, select your image and then go to `settings` and make it public.

[#jib]
== Using Jib

https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[Jib] builds optimized Docker and OCI images for your Java applications without a Docker daemon - and without deep mastery of Docker best practices.

Quarkus comes with an extension for Jib : 

[.console-input]
[source,config,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="io.quarkus:quarkus-container-image-jib"
----

Then add those properties (but replace with your Quay username): 

[.console-input]
[source, properties]
----

quarkus.container-image.group=rhdevelopers
quarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io
quarkus.container-image.name=quarkus-app-workshop
----

You can now and push your image in one command : 

[.console-input]
[source,config,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.container-image.push=true
----

Alternatively you can also add this to the properties and each time your build your app the image will also be built and pushed : 

[.console-input]
[source, properties]
----

quarkus.container-image.push=true
----


[#buildpacks]
== Using Buildpacks

The extension `quarkus-container-image-buildpack` is using buildpacks in order to perform container image builds. Under the hood buildpacks will use a Docker daemon for the actual build. While buildpacks support alternatives to Docker, this extension will only work with Docker.

[.console-input]
[source,config,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="container-image-buildpack"
----

You need to specify a builder image : 

[.console-input]
[source, properties]
----

quarkus.buildpack.jvm-builder-image=codejive/buildpacks-quarkus-builder
----

And again now you can build and push your image : 

[.console-input]
[source,config,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.container-image.push=true
----

IMPORTANT: When using the buildpack container image extension it is strongly advised to avoid adding `quarkus.container-image.build=true` in your properties configuration as it might trigger nesting builds within builds. It’s preferable to pass it as an option to the build command instead.
